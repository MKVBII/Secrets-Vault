Implementation of a secrets vault software that stores usernames and passswords for services (websites) in a protected centralized repository so that secrets are note stored across a system ("secrets sprawl"). 

Real World Implementations: 
- Hashicorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Kapersky Vault
- LastPass Vault

Operations:
- Add a new service name, username, and password triple

- Lookup a user's name-password pair for a given website

- Add a new service name and user name with a randomly generated password of specific length

- Add a new service name and private key pair 

- Lookup an ElGamal private key given a service name and putput as a Base64 encoded string

- Add a new service name and private key with a freshly generated 512-bit ElGamal key pair with the public key outputted to the screen as a Base 64 string



All Passwords (except for auto generated ones): password

TESTING âœ…
# Commands to test functionality required by the project description:


1. Initial Vault Creation and Basic Password Storage âœ…
First, create the vault and add a simple password entry:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --add --service gmail --user john.doe@gmail.com
Enter your vault password when prompted, and then enter a service password when prompted.

2. Verify Password Retrieval Works âœ…
Next, confirm you can retrieve the password you just stored:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-pass gmail
Enter your vault password when prompted. This should display the username and password for the gmail service.

3. Test Auto-Generated Password Feature âœ…
Add a password using the auto-generation feature with a sufficient length:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --add --service twitter --user twitteruser --gen 12
Enter your vault password when prompted. The system should generate a 12-character password.

4. Verify Auto-Generated Password Retrieval âœ…
Confirm you can retrieve the auto-generated password:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-pass twitter
Enter your vault password when prompted. You should see the username and the generated password.

5. Test Password Length Warning âœ…
Test the warning for short passwords:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --add --service short --user shortuser --gen 5
Enter your vault password when prompted. This should display a warning about the password being less than 7 characters but still add it.

6. Verify Short Password Storage âœ…
Confirm the short password was stored despite the warning:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-pass short
Enter your vault password when prompted. You should see the username and the short password.

7. Test Invalid Password Length Validation âœ…
Test the validation for invalid password length:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --add --service invalid --user invaliduser --gen 0
This should fail with an error message and not add the password to the vault.

8. Add a Private Key Manually âœ…
Now test the private key functionality by adding a key manually:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --add --service ssh --key "MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQCtVJECJBVB"
Enter your vault password when prompted. The system should confirm the key was added.

9. Verify Manual Private Key Retrieval âœ…
Confirm you can retrieve the manually added key:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-key ssh
Enter your vault password when prompted. You should see the private key you added.

10. Generate an ElGamal Key Pair âœ…
Test the key generation functionality:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --add --service github --keygen
Enter your vault password when prompted. The system should generate a key pair, display the public key, and store the private key.

11. Verify Generated Private Key Retrieval âœ…
Confirm you can retrieve the generated private key:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-key github
Enter your vault password when prompted. You should see the private key that was generated.

12. Test Error Handling for Non-Existent Entries âœ…
Test how the system handles lookups for non-existent entries:
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-pass nonexistent
Enter your vault password when prompted. The system should handle this gracefully with a "not found" message.
# java -cp "bin:lib/*:." App --lookup-key nonexistent
Enter your vault password when prompted. The system should handle this gracefully with a "not found" message.
